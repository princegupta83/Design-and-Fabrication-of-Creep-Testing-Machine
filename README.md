# Design and Fabrication of Creep Testing Machine
Creep Testing Machine Project â€“ Designed and developed a custom creep testing setup to analyze time-dependent deformation in materials. Included casting and testing of aluminum composite samples, with service life prediction through extrapolation of lab-based creep data to real-world conditions.
